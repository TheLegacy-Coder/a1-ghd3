Assignment 1 - Hello World: GitHub and d3  
===

For this project, my main goal was to recreate a red 1984 Audi Quattro Sport (https://supercarnostalgia.com/blog/for-sale-1984-audi-quattro-sport-usa-1) using rectangles, circles, lines, and polygons. I manually appended individual elements to an SVG, and positioned/styled them in such a way that when combined, the recreation of the car is shown.

**As a note, I will add screenshots later (project still hasn't been finalized).

Technical Achievements:
---
- Created an array to hold positional data for the creation of polygons/trapezoids.
- Made use of the area() method in d3 to create the aforementioned polygons/trapezoids (one for the hood and another for the windshield).
- **As a note, I plan on adding a toggle to turn the vehicle's headlights on and off, which may require using certain methods on d3 elements.

Design Achievements:
---
- Was able to make use of numerous individual elements to recreate the front end of a vehicle.
- **As touched upon in the technical achievements section, will add headlights (essentially elements that will change color once the toggle is clicked, or could show/hide elements instead).
